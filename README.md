## TODO
Remove osc message reading
Init empty tracks for the sequence
	We could keep a EMSTrack object which stores the track parameters and generate/edit a midi Track from that
Get midi inputs from device
	update the corresponding EMSTrack
	generate midi Track with euclidean generator function
	update the corresponding midi Track 

draw()
	draw circular sequences basing on current midi Tracks
	draw play/pause/stop buttons
